# Section Introduction

The [Account Setup and Management](/account-setup-and-management) section will go into detail about how to set up and manage your account in the TreeFort portal. The section begins by walking you through the account creation process, including: working with an administrator at your organization to send you a request to create an account, creating your account and password, and logging in for the first time. You will also find articles in this section outlining how to manage your account settings, and what to do in the event you forget your account ID or password.

If you have already set up your account in the TreeFort portal, you can skip ahead to the [Getting Started](/getting-started) section for more information on navigating and using the TreeFort portal.

If you are an administrator at your organization and want more information on managing your organizationâ€™s account, you can find this information in the [Managing Your Organization](#) section.
