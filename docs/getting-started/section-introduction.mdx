The [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/section-introduction/) section will go into detail about the features available in your TreeFort account, including: navigating around the portal, managing files and clients, initiating a TreeFort ID verification, and reviewing the TreeFort ID verification report.

If you do not already have a TreeFort account, you can find more information on creating an account in the [Account Setup and Management](/docs/account-setup-and-management/section-introduction/) section.

If you are an administrator at your organization and want more information on managing your organizationâ€™s account, you can find this information in the [Managing Your Organization](/docs/managing-your-organization/section-introduction/) section.
