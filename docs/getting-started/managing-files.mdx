# Managing Files
After logging into the TreeFort portal, you will be directed to the Files tab, as shown below.

![img alt](/img/getting-started/getting-started-1.png)

Files are used to organize your client ID verifications, and to assign costs incurred through use of the TreeFort portal (e.g. costs incurred for initiating an ID verification with a client) to a file for your internal billing or tracking purposes.

All existing files for your organization will appear in the left-hand column, and the currently selected file will appear on the right-hand side of the screen when selected. You can navigate to a new file by selecting it from the left-hand column, as shown below.

### Searching and Filtering Files 
You also have a few different tools that will allow you to easily find a file you are looking for in the TreeFort portal, which are outlined below.

#### Searching Files
You can search for a file by **File Name** or **File Number** by typing into the search bar and selecting **Search**. Any files matching your search will appear in the left-hand column, and can be selected, as shown below.

### Filtering Files with Advanced Search
You can also filter files according to **File Status** and **Date Range** by using the **Advanced Search** functionality, both of which are described below.

#### Filter by File Status
To filter by file status, select the **Advanced Search** bar and use the file status dropdown to select the file status you want to sort by. Once selected, all files corresponding to the file status selected will be available to select from the left-hand column, as shown below.

The file statuses are explained later in this article in the **Understanding File Statuses** section.

#### Filter by Date Range
To filter by date range, select the **Advanced Search** bar and use the date range filter to select a **From Date** and a **To Date**, as shown below. Note that you can combine the Date Range filter with the File Status filter for even more refined filtering.

### Show Only My Files
By default, only files that you have created will appear in the left-hand column and will be available to select, search, and filter. To view all files created by any team member at your organization, toggle the **Show Only My Files** toggle button, as shown below. By toggling this option, you can switch between having only files that you have created or files that any team member at your organization has created available for viewing and selection from the left-hand column.

<video autoplay controls loop muted src="https://treefort.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/5.webm"></video>
To create a new file, select the **Create New File** button, as shown below. Once selected, you will have to enter the following information, which will allow you to more easily search files and assign costs incurred through use of the TreeFort portal (e.g. costs incurred for initiating an ID verification with a client) to a file for your internal billing or tracking purposes.


**File Name:** a name to reference the file you are creating.

**File Number:** a unique number or code of your choosing that is associated to only this file.

Once you have entered the required information, select **Save** to create the file. The newly created file will appear at the top of the files in the left-hand column, and will be automatically selected and visible on the right-hand side of the screen.

### Protecting Files

By default, all files created by you will be visible to any team member at your organization, and other team members will be able to view and edit any information within the file. While this is intended to allow collaboration with other individuals at your organization or within your team, you have the ability to make the file only visible and editable by you. To do so, select the **Protect File** toggle button when creating a new file, as shown below. Selecting this option will ensure that only you and your organization’s administrators will be able to view and make changes to this file. Note that a file can be protected or unprotected at any time by editing a file, as described later in this article in the **Editing Files** section.

### Editing Files
To edit the **File Name** or **File Number**, or to change the protected status of the file, select the edit icon when the file you want to edit is selected, and then choose the **Edit** option, as shown below. A popup will appear, allowing you to change the basic file information. Once you have made your desired changes, select **Save**. The updated file information will be reflected throughout the portal.

### Cancelling Files
If you created a file that you no longer require, you can cancel the file at any time after you have opened the file. To cancel a file, select the edit icon when the file you want to cancel is selected, and then choose the **Cancel** option, as shown below. Cancelling a file changes the file status to **Cancelled** and prevents future file status updates so that you know there is no further action required on that file. File statuses are explained in greater detail in the **Understanding File Statuses** section later in this article.

<video autoplay   controls   loop   muted   src="https://treefort.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/9.webm"></video>
### Closing Files
If you have successfully verified all the clients associated with a file and the file is ready to be closed, you can close the file by selecting the edit icon when the file you want to close is selected, and then choose the **Close** option, as shown below. Closing a file changes the file status to **Closed** and prevents future file status updates so that you know there is no further action required on that file. Note that you can only close a file if all clients associated with that file have been successfully verified. File statuses are explained in greater detail in the **Understanding File Statuses** section later in this article.

### Reopening Files
If you want to reopen a file you previously cancelled or closed, you can reopen the file at any time. To reopen a file, select the edit icon when the file you want to reopen is selected, and then choose the **Reopen** option, as shown below. Reopening a file restores the file status and allows future file status updates to occur on this file. File statuses are explained in greater detail in the **Understanding File Statuses** section later in this article.

### Understanding File Statuses
There are multiple file statuses in TreeFort which change as the file progresses and certain actions are taken in relation to a file. The file status can be seen in the file list in the left-hand column, and on the right-hand side once a file is selected, as highlighted below.

![img alt](/img/getting-started/getting-started-2.png)

As mentioned in the **Filter by Status** section of this article, files can be filtered according to status. Every file status is outlined below:

**New:** when a new file is created in TreeFort, it will be designated as a **New** file, and will remain in **New** status until at least one client is attached to the file. More information on attaching clients to a file can be found in the **Managing Clients** section.

**In Progress:** if there are one or more clients attached to a file who have not yet completed the ID verification process and therefore are not marked as “verified” (either because the ID verification request has not been sent to the client, the ID verification is pending, or the ID verification was rejected), then the file will have a status of **In Progress**.

**Action Required:** this status indicates that there is a client attached to this file that requires an action on behalf of you or someone at your organization. A file will be marked as **Action Required** if an ID verification report has been returned and is awaiting approval.

**Complete:** if all clients attached to a file have completed the ID verification process and are marked as “verified”, the file will be marked as **Complete**. If a new client is subsequently attached to this file, or if an existing ID verification associated to this file is altered, the file status may revert to one of the statuses mentioned previously.

**Cancelled:** Cancelling a file changes the file status to **Cancelled** and prevents future file status updates so that you know there is no further action required on that file. As previously mentioned in the **Reopening Files** section of this article, reopening a file restores the file status and allows future file status updates to occur on this file.

**Closed:** Similar to cancelling a file, closing a file changes the file status to **Closed** and prevents future file status updates so that you know there is no further action required on that file. However, unlike cancelling a file, a file can only be closed when it is in the **Complete** status, as the **Closed** status is intended to mark that the file has been completed and can now be closed. As previously mentioned in the **Reopening Files** section of this article, reopening a file restores the file status and allows future file status updates to occur on this file.
