# Identified Risks Quick Reference

This article details all the identified risks that you may encounter when reviewing TreeFort Reports, as well as common causes for each identified risk. This can be used as a helpful reference when reviewing client reports to provide insight into why a client failed the TreeFort ID verification or why a certain identified risk is present on a clientâ€™s TreeFort Report.

Note: risks shown on a TreeFort Report do not necessarily mean that a fraud is being perpetrated by the client, but depending on the severity of the risks identified, you may want to ask for a satisfactory explanation from the client before continuing to interact with the client. This also applies to identified risks that are marked as Automatic Failure and result in a failed TreeFort ID verification report. In certain cases, it is possible that the client simply did not complete the process correctly, or that the data used in the ID verification process was inputted incorrectly by a team member at your organization. A full list of common reasons for each identified risk is outlined below, organized according to severity (low risk to automatic failure).
